# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). 

Using only HTML and CSS, I managed to create a replica of the project. I decided to add a couple of things to make it slightly different than the original.

## My process

So, to begin this projcet, I ndecided to break down each element I saw into different sections and organize it accordingly. 

Once, I had it organized, it was time for me to begin the project. I first started with HTML. Once it was how I wanted/needed, I began the styling using CSS. Thanks to Frontend Mentor, they were able to provide a style guide with the fonts and colors. 

The CSS portion of is always a challenge. Centering a div is always a complicated thing for me but, I made it and completed it. 

### What I learned

What I learned from this project is how to properly size a picture as well as centering a huge div container in order to center the entire project. It was a fun challenge overall.

### Continued development

In the future, I would love to continue styling. CSS, I think, is my weaker area between HTML and CSS. Media quieries is still new to me so practice makes perfect.
